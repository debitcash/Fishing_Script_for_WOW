### World of Warcraft Fishing Automation

Automates fishing in World of Warcraft by detecting fishing floats using image processing. The script performs fishing attempts, detects when a fish bites by comparing image snapshots, and automatically catches the fish. Achieves around 40% efficiency, enhancing fishing skill and item collection.
